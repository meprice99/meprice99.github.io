	<p class="subhead"><span class="subhead">Flexible Brush Tip & Fine Bullet Tip in One Pen</span></p>
	<p>Flexible brush tip works like a paintbrush to create fine, medium, or bold strokes making them the perfect tool for hand lettering, illustration, drawing, rubber stamping, and more. Made of smooth and resilient nylon fibers, making them durable enough to take on pressure without breaking or losing their original shape even after extensive use! Fine bullet tip is strong and firm, giving a consistent fine line perfect for drawing embellishments, intricate designs, details, and writing! Tips are self-cleaning, allowing you to mix and blend colors without fear of permanently staining or ruining your marker-simply brush onto scrap paper to clean the tip!</p>
	<p><span class="subhead">108 Color Coded Caps</span></p>
		<p>Color-coded caps for ease in organization and quick selection of the 108 colors while keeping tips air tight and fresh! The brush pen cap also features an 'anti-roll' design which is perfect for busy artists and cluttered work spaces!</p>
	<p><span class="subhead">Vibrant Water-Based Ink</span></p>
<p>Easily mix and blend ink to create an array of new colors. Blend two ink colors together or use the colorless blender pen to create watercolor effects. You can also simply add water using a paintbrush to create soft subtle color washes!</p>

5.0 out of 5 stars<br><i>New Fan of Tombow!</i><br>
I have purchased so many different markers lately. My granddaughter and I love to color. I have the Staedtler Johanna Basford Triplus Fineliner Pens for Adult Coloring Books and Prismacolor Premier Colored Pencils, Soft Core. Sharpies big and small and ultra fine point. BIC Marking Permanent Marker Fashion Colors, Ultra Fine Point, Assorted Colors. Write Dudes Ultra Fine-Point Infinity pens, 8 Count, which are really really good for pens but not nearly enough colors. All that aside these Tombow are to die for!!! I could not be more exited with the quality and the fluid flow onto paper. I have found that paper in coloring books are as big a key as the marker. I have severe arthritis in my hands and found that pencils need to be pressed harder to color the area without leaving the white paper showing. Too hard on my hands and I love Staedtler pencils but Prismacolor is a deeper cover quality. Copic markers are the very top of the line and I love them but can't afford them since I am NOT a real artist that is producing my own work. I'm simply coloring for fun but its no fun when some markers bleed so heavy or some pull the paper up. Sharpies are great especially the ultra fine point but not enough colors. Bic bleeds outward so it will bleed over the line if not careful. To me Staedtler and Johanna's stuff is way over rated and now so commercialized that the quality seems to have gone down and my recent purchase of Staedtler Duo color Markers was disappointing.. Stabilo Point 68 is a really good brand for those tiny hard to get areas and the colors are wonderful. Faber-Castel is affordable and mostly pretty good with the pitt artist brush, slightly expensive but a lot less than copic. They have a kids quality marker that is good as for my granddaughter. But all in all after trying these awesome Tombow I ordered more sets in different colors and can not wait for them to arrive. They are the best.</p>

1.0 out of 5 stars <br><i>These are not brush pens</i><br>
A brush pen is shaped like this sure...but there are solid foam nibs that do not push down as you write like true brush pens do. You cannot get thicker and thinner lines with these. They are regular markers. NOT brush markers.</p>
